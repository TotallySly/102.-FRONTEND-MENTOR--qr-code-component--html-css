### What I learned

This was more of a revision of basic HTML 5 and CSS. I have been learning on and off for several months now. But I would say I am still a beginner on my Web Development journey. And as such, I feel like I have followed enough 'Code Along' videos and mini-projects, that I feel comfortable to take on various challenges to improve my educational development.

I am happy that my QR Code is responsive. But I am annoyed that the structure is not totally consistent throughout - i.e. the text changes position on various screen sizes and is not 100% consistent.

### Continued development

I feel comfortable with HTML5 and CSS. I am still trying to figure out which units of measurement to use. There seems to be a hot topic of debate regarding this. I have been warned of 'Tutorial Hell', but no one warned of the Unit of Measurement Rabbit Hole!

I settled for a mix of px, rem, em, and % as this is a more simpler challenge. As the challenges get harder, I will need to settle upon a method.

Media Queries! I guess once I have developed a better understanding of the different units of measurements, this will also become easier?
